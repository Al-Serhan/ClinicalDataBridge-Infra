  # OpenTofu/Terraform quality checks are run via Makefile instead:
  # - make fmt      : Format code
  # - make validate : Validate syntax
  # - make lint     : Run tflint
  # - make test     : Run all quality checks

  # Conventional commits (optional - uncomment when team grows)
  # Enforces conventional commit format: type(scope): subject
  # Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, ci, perf
